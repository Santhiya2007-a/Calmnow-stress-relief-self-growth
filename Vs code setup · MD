## 📁 Files Created Automatically:

When you run the app, these files are created:

1. **users_data.csv**
   - Stores username and password
   - Located in same folder as app

2. **user_thoughts.csv**
   - Stores all journals, moods, reflections
   - Columns: username, timestamp, thought_type, content

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Problem: Port already in use
```bash
streamlit run calmnow_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Problem: Module not found
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit pandas
```

### Problem: Can't see butterflies animation
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- The butterflies are CSS animations and should work automatically
